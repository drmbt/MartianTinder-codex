## Done

*Sessions will append completed work summaries here*

### Session 1 - Complete MVP Foundation
**Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Node.js Version**: Upgraded from v18.13.0 to v24.7.0

**Major Accomplishments:**
- ✅ **Complete project scaffolding** with modern tech stack
- ✅ **NextAuth v5 integration** with working magic link authentication
- ✅ **Full database schema** implemented and tested
- ✅ **Core user flows** working end-to-end
- ✅ **Channel management** with creation and joining functionality
- ✅ **Proposal system** with creation and viewing capabilities

**Key Features Working:**
1. **Authentication Flow**: Email magic link → user creation → session management
2. **Channel Management**: Create channels, join via invite codes, view channel lists
3. **Proposal System**: Create proposals, view details, navigate between pages
4. **Navigation**: Full app navigation with protected routes and proper redirects
5. **Database Operations**: All CRUD operations for channels and proposals working

**Technical Achievements:**
- NextAuth v5 with modern `auth()` function pattern
- Prisma 6.15 with complete relational schema (8 models)
- shadcn/ui component library fully integrated
- TypeScript strict mode with proper type safety
- Zod validation schemas for all API inputs
- Mobile-responsive design with Tailwind CSS

**Files Created (35+ TypeScript files):**
- Complete authentication system (login, verification, session management)
- Channel system (listing, creation, joining, feeds)
- Proposal system (creation, detail view, form validation)
- API routes (auth, channels, proposals)
- UI components (forms, modals, cards, navigation)
- Type definitions and validation schemas

**Database Schema:**
- User (with NextAuth integration)
- Channel (with invite codes and member roles)
- Proposal (with full lifecycle support)
- SupportSignal (ready for Sprint 3)
- Event (ready for Sprint 4)
- ProposalUserState (ready for Sprint 3)

**Current Status**: 
- **Sprint 1**: ✅ COMPLETE
- **Sprint 2**: ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE (core functionality working)
- **Ready for Sprint 3**: Support signal implementation

**Next Session Priorities:**
1. Implement support signal system (Support/SuperSupport/Oppose buttons)
2. Add threshold detection and owner confirmation flow
3. Build feed ordering and filtering (FIFO, expired item handling)
4. Implement skip/dismiss/star functionality

**Known Issues to Address:**
- Some TypeScript type imports need refinement
- Support signal buttons are UI-only (need backend integration)
- Feed filtering and ordering not yet implemented
- Scheduled publishing functionality not yet implemented

**Authentication Test Flow:**
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Get Started" → Login page
3. Enter email → Magic link logged to console
4. Copy magic link URL → Paste in browser → Redirects to channels
5. Full authentication working with session persistence ~
