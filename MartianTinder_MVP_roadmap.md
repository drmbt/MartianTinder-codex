this document is compiled from conversations with chatGPT about the project and core functionality, MVP and roadmap for the project. is there anything missing from this overview that would need clarification before you start to scaffold the project? 

I'm building a community organization app codenamed Martian Tinder meant to help small groups and teams coordinate, self govern, and organize tasks, activities, workshops etc. into cohorts or circles providing calendar sync and communication channels for interesting parties. the main UX is a tinder style feed for "proposals", where users can quickly parse through invitations, notifications, announcements, requests, or other proposals, signaling interest, commitment, or dissension and providing a way to RSVP or otherwise indicate support. 

Building on top of google calendar integration makes this a more achievable lift without creating new standards

# One-liner

A locally hosted, auth-gated community app that lets people publish **Proposals**; others swipe to signal support, supersupport, opposition, or skip; once a threshold is met, the proposal graduates into a scheduled **Event** with Google Calendar sync and a purpose-built comms thread.

# Core objects

- **Channel**: topical or group space you can join or be invited to; proposals live here; feed is channel-scoped.
    
- **Proposal**: hypothesis or intention that may become an event if it earns enough support. Fields: title, note, min/max capacity, threshold, visibility prefs, anonymity prefs, publish date, expiration date, optional user provided thumbnail image or AI-generated splashscreen background.
    
- **Support Signal**: left dismiss, right support, up supersupport, down oppose; support can be public or anonymous; optional “haters” cohort.
    
- **Event**: a reified proposal after threshold and owner confirmation; can auto-create calendar entries for confirmed supporters.
    
- **Thread**: comms space linked to a proposal; public or private to supporters; owner can proctor and curate access.
    

# States and lifecycle

Draft in user account; scheduled publish; **Published**; accrues signals; optional moderation for scarce seats; **Threshold met** then owner auto-confirm or manual confirm; **Reify** into Event; calendar sync to supporters; **Expire** if unmet; on expiration prompt owner to confirm, reschedule, or archive.

# Roles and permissions

- **Owner/Creator**: configures proposal parameters, visibility, anonymity, moderation rules, threshold behavior; can curate supporters into limited seats.
    
- **Supporter/Committer**: expresses support or supersupport; may commit resources or action per proposal definition.
    
- **Opponent/Hater**: can downvote; optionally visible in a separate cohort if configured.
    
- **Channel Admins**: invite, manage visibility, and set defaults.
    

# Interaction model

- **Feed UI**: full-screen swipeable cards; tap to expand details; left dismiss to archive; right support; up supersupport; down oppose; “skip” to push to end of queue.
    
- **Card design**: simple template; upload and position image; minimal story-style text tools; optional AI image generation from a background prompt.
    
- **Support meter**: visual bar showing supporters vs max capacity; notch for threshold; expandable list of public supporters if enabled.
    

# Scheduling and availability

- Google auth; per-user calendar sync; upon reification, add events to calendars for confirmed supporters.
    
- Optionally offer a time window or several slots; collect availability signals; owner can finalize a time or let the system suggest based on overlap; Calendly-style flows later in the roadmap.
    

# Governance and social uses

- Beyond events, proposals can be vibe checks, petitions, norms setting, calls for volunteers, rideshares, resource offers, or social posts; channels become flexible bulletin boards that surface interest and create focused cohorts with just-enough process.
    

# Privacy and visibility

- Proposal visibility can be public within a channel or restricted; comments can be public or limited to supporters; supporters can choose anonymity; haters can be public or private per config.
    

# Outcomes

- If threshold met: owner confirms and promises the stated intention; event is created; seats are allocated per rules; calendars updated; thread continues.
    
- If not met by expiry: prompt owner to revise, extend, or archive.
# MVP scope (v0)

- **Auth**: email magic link (Auth.js). Optional Google SSO for login later.
    
- **Channels**: create/join via invite link; simple list.
    
- **Proposals**: draft → publish (immediate or scheduled) → support flow → optional reify to event.
    
- **Feed**: per-channel, swipe-like actions (buttons for MVP): Support, SuperSupport, Oppose, Skip, Dismiss.
    
- **Dashboard**: your commitments (supported/supersupported), upcoming events, past.
    
- **Calendar export**:
    
    - **ICS downloads** for single event and per-user feed.
        
    - **“Add to Google Calendar” template links** (no API / OAuth required).
        
    - Stretch: actual Google OAuth + API write.
        

No messaging UI in MVP. Each proposal can hold an **external chat link** (Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/Slack).

# Minimal stack

- **Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript** — single app, no separate API service.
    
- **Prisma + SQLite** (file DB) for local-first dev and LAN deploy. Postgres migration later is trivial.
    
- **Auth.js** (email magic link via SMTP you control; swap in Google SSO later).
    
- **Tailwind + shadcn/ui** for fast UI.
    
- **Zod** for input validation.
    
- **ical-generator** for ICS.
    
- **No queues, no websockets**. Status derived at read-time from timestamps; polling only if needed.
    

Why this works: one process, one DB file, one SMTP config, zero background workers.

# Data model (MVP)

Prisma sketch (trimmed to essentials):

`model User {   id            String   @id @default(cuid())   email         String   @unique   name          String?   image         String?   createdAt     DateTime @default(now())   memberships   ChannelMember[]   supports      SupportSignal[]   states        ProposalUserState[] }  model Channel {   id          String   @id @default(cuid())   name        String   inviteCode  String   @unique   createdAt   DateTime @default(now())   members     ChannelMember[]   proposals   Proposal[] }  model ChannelMember {   id        String   @id @default(cuid())   userId    String   channelId String   role      String   // "owner" | "moderator" | "member"   createdAt DateTime @default(now())   @@unique([userId, channelId]) }  model Proposal {   id             String   @id @default(cuid())   channelId      String   ownerId        String   title          String   note           String   imageUrl       String?   minCapacity    Int?   maxCapacity    Int?   threshold      Int?     // if null, threshold == minCapacity || simple quorum rule   publishAt      DateTime? // null = publish now   expiresAt      DateTime?   visibility     String   // "channel" | "public"   allowAnonymous Boolean  @default(false)   moderationMode String   // "auto" | "manual"   externalChatUrl String?   createdAt      DateTime @default(now())   updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt   // computed status in queries from publishAt/expiresAt & support counts   supports       SupportSignal[]   states         ProposalUserState[]   event          Event? }  model SupportSignal {   id         String   @id @default(cuid())   userId     String   proposalId String   type       String   // "support" | "supersupport" | "oppose"   visibility String   // "public" | "anonymous"   createdAt  DateTime @default(now())   @@unique([userId, proposalId]) }  model ProposalUserState {   id         String   @id @default(cuid())   userId     String   proposalId String   state      String   // "none" | "skipped" | "dismissed" | "starred"   updatedAt  DateTime @default(now())   @@unique([userId, proposalId]) }  model Event {   id          String   @id @default(cuid())   proposalId  String   @unique   title       String   startAt     DateTime   endAt       DateTime?   location    String?   icsUid      String   @unique   createdAt   DateTime @default(now()) }`

# Core flows (no workers)

- **Publishing**: when viewing the feed, the API treats `status = published` if `publishAt == null || publishAt <= now` and not expired.
    
- **Expiration**: treat as expired if `expiresAt && expiresAt < now`. Surface prompts to owner to re-publish or archive.
    
- **Threshold met**: on each support change, compute counts in-transaction; if counts ≥ threshold/capacity rule, show “Confirm & Create Event”.
    
- **Reify**: owner picks time window or single time; creates `Event`. From event page: buttons for **Download .ics** and **Add to Google Calendar** (template link). Also a per-user **My Events .ics** feed.
    

---

# Calendar export details

**ICS** (via `ical-generator`):

- `GET /api/ics/event/:id.ics` – single event file.
    
- `GET /api/ics/user/:id.ics` – rolling feed of that user’s accepted events.
    

**Google Calendar template link** (no OAuth):

`https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render   ?action=TEMPLATE   &text=ENCODED_TITLE   &details=ENCODED_DESCRIPTION   &location=ENCODED_LOCATION   &dates=YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ/YYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`

Generate on the client for each event detail page.

Stretch later: OAuth + API write to create events automatically.

---

# App surface (pages)

- `/login` magic link
    
- `/channels` list + “Join via invite”
    
- `/c/:channelId` feed with cards (buttons: Support, SuperSupport, Oppose, Skip, Dismiss)
    
- `/p/new` proposal wizard (title, note, capacity, threshold, schedule, external chat link, image upload or AI later)
    
- `/p/:id` proposal detail with support meter and supporters (when public)
    
- `/dashboard` commitments: supported, upcoming events, past, starred
    
- `/events/:id` event detail with ICS + Google link
    

---

# API routes (MVP)

- `POST /api/auth/*` (Auth.js)
    
- `GET /api/channels`, `POST /api/channels`, `POST /api/channels/join`
    
- `POST /api/proposals` (draft), `PATCH /api/proposals/:id` (publish/update)
    
- `POST /api/proposals/:id/signal` `{ type, visibility }` upsert
    
- `POST /api/proposals/:id/state` `{ state }` skip/dismiss/star
    
- `POST /api/proposals/:id/reify` `{ startAt, endAt, location }`
    
- `GET /api/feed?channelId=...&filter=...`
    
- `GET /api/ics/event/:id.ics`, `GET /api/ics/user/:id.ics`
